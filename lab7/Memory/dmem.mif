DEPTH=1024; 	% Memory depth and width are required 
		% DEPTH is the number of addresses

-- Specify values for addresses, which can be single address or range
-- SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER
-- 1) This memory is word-addressable, versus the MIPS conceptual byte-addressable memory.
--    This means that address 1 corresponds to word 1, address 2 corresponds to word 2, etc.
-- 2) The data values need to be in 32-bit hex form (i.e. don't use F when you really mean 0000000F).
--    The address values need to be in decimal.
--    format:
--      ADDRESS : DATA
--    Use [START..END] : DATA to set a data value to an entire range
